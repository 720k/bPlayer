KNOWN ISSUES:

- After first playback beckend crash (MPV controller crash)
    POSSIBLE SOLUTION:
    Quit request by MPV OSD should not destroy MPV controller instance

- Windows:  FrontEnd <-> ConduitD via TCP socket instead of LocalSocket (NamedPipe)
    POSSIBLE SOLUTION:
    1) rewrite ConduitD to listen on LocalSocket (
    2) lower device port privileges with .inf files or registry hack so ConduitD becomes useless

- No visual feedback when seeking video forward, it takes a lot of time
