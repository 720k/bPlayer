

TO-DO:
- Common/ should be a library!
- convert project to CMAKE
- FrontEnd: StreamProtocol handled in separate thread (better efficiency)

WORK-IN-PROGRESS:
- MPV controller : logic start/stop/pause
- MPV realtime info (position, state) forwarded to frontend (necessary for audio)
- MPV controller : add stream seeking visual feedback

DONE:
- Reimplement StreamProtocol::Size with local cachin because MPV call it so many times
- logging system to stdout even on release build with classes none/info/debug/trace
